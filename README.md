Title: Real-Time Face Recognition using OpenCV and Python

Description:
This project utilizes OpenCV and Python's face_recognition library to implement real-time face recognition through a webcam. By encoding facial features and comparing them in real-time, the system can identify known faces accurately and efficiently. The project provides a comprehensive tutorial on setting up the environment, capturing video from a webcam, detecting faces, encoding facial features, comparing faces, and ultimately recognizing individuals in real-time.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a robust system for real-time face recognition using readily available tools like OpenCV and Python. Through this project, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of face recognition algorithms.
- Learn how to use OpenCV for accessing and processing video from a webcam.
- Implement face detection and recognition functionalities using the face_recognition library.
- Encode facial features and compare them for accurate recognition.
- Create a real-time face recognition system capable of identifying known individuals from a live video stream.
- Explore potential applications of real-time face recognition in security, surveillance, and access control systems.
